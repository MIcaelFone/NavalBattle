# Naval Battle
<p> The Naval Battle is a game in which you insert all three types of vessels in a matrix, although the coordinates (row, column) and the types of vessels are Aircraft Carrier, Cruiser, and frigate,and the game has a attacker player who will try hit all the vessels </p>
<h2>How the game works</h2>
<p> The player needs to insert all the vessels in the Defense matrix, and the attacker has 50 chances to hit all the vessels. The aircraft carrier in the game is represented by "A" ,the Cruiser is represented by "C," and the Frigate is represented by "F". The aircraft carrier has 4 parts, the cruiser has 3 parts, and the frigate has 2 parts.</p>

<h2>How the score works</h2>
<p> When the attacker hit a part of aircraft carrier, he scores 30 points, if he hits a part of a cruiser, he scores 40 points; and when the attacker hit a part of frigate will score 50 points.If the attacker tries 50 chances without hit all the vessels ,he lose the game</p>
